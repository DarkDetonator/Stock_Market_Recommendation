##  Overview
This repository hosts a Flask-based web application for stock prediction, leveraging the **XGBoost** machine learning model. The project encompasses:

- Data extraction from *NSE* and *Moneycontrol*
- Synthetic data generation
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- A user-friendly interface with login functionality

It provides stock recommendations, growth scores, and financial calculations for companies, including those in the **Nifty 50** index.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Run the following commands to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone = https://github.com/DarkDetonator/Stock_Market_Recommendation.git
   cd stock-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
   Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows, use:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Database**  
   - Set up a MySQL database.  
   - Update the database connection details in `generatingSyntheticData/insert_into_db.py` and other relevant scripts.

##  Usage

### 1. Start the Login Server
> **Note**: The login server must be started first as it is interconnected with the main application.

Navigate to the `login/` directory and start the server:

```bash
cd StockPredictApp/login
python login_server.py
# Replace with the actual login server script name if different
```

Ensure the login server is running before proceeding.

### 2. Start the Main Application
Return to the parent directory and start the main application:

```bash
cd ..
python app.py
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

### 3. Data Extraction and Synthetic Data Generation
Follow these sub-steps:

1. **Scrape Data** from NSE and Moneycontrol:  
   Navigate to the `web_Scraping/` directory and run the scripts:

   ```bash
   cd web_Scraping
   python nse_extraction.py
   python mony_contol.py
   ```

2. **Generate Synthetic Data** if real data is insufficient:  
   Navigate to the `generatingSyntheticData/` directory and run the script:

   ```bash
   cd ../generatingSyntheticData
   python synthetic_data.py
   ```

3. **Insert Data** into the database:  
   Insert the scraped or synthetic data into the database:

   ```bash
   python insert_into_db.py
   ```

### 4. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
Train the XGBoost model and tune hyperparameters:

```bash
cd horizon_Prediction
python XGBoostModel.py
```
